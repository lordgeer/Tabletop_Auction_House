## Description

*Our goal is to create an auction house interface for roleplaying game masters and players to buy, sell, and trade in-game items for fun and profit.*

Tabletop Auction House provides a marketplace for gamers and game masters to create and exchange in-game equipment, both reducing the creative pressure on the gm and establishing a unique channel by which games might grow and evolve.

Sometimes you don’t want to have to think about the ‘simple’ things when it comes to world-building. Our marketplace takes some of that pressure off while also creating a way to advance the story to whatever depth is desired by the team.

As a game master, you can:

* Display ordinary items for players to purchase
* Introduce items that affect the narrative and move the party in new ways through their environment

As a gamer, you can:

* See gear standards for your game
* Grab cool items for your character

Visit the Tabletop Auction House today for your roleplaying marketplace needs.

Tabletop Auction House uses JavaScript, Handlebars, MySQL/JawsDB, Heroku, Tailwind CSS, Book Brush, and a Favicon Generator. More technologies that we would like to add in the future include Cloudinary and RPG-Awesome.
